In Phase4
The  project is to design, develop, and evaluate intelligent quality control systems that leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to enable automated defect detection, process optimization, and predictive maintenance in manufacturing environments.
In the context of quality control, perception systems involve using sensors and AI to "see" and interpret the quality of manufactured products and the manufacturing process itself.	Performance Enhancements:
○	Sensor Fusion Algorithms: Combined data from cameras, laser scanners, and other sensors to provide a comprehensive view of product quality and identify defects from multiple perspectives.
○	Real-Time Defect Detection Models: Deployed advanced AI models (e.g., YOLOv7, PointNet++) to enhance the speed and accuracy of identifying defects on the production line.
○	Adaptive Noise Filtering: Applied Kalman filters and AI-based denoising techniques to improve the quality of sensor data, ensuring accurate defect detection even in noisy manufacturing environments.
●	Outcome: The improved perception system enabled real-time quality monitoring and adaptive process adjustments based on detected defects.

●Overview: In quality control, this translates to precisely locating and mapping defects on a product or within the manufacturing process, as well as mapping variations in production parameters across the factory floor.
●	Performance Enhancements:
○	Defect Localization Accuracy: Enhanced algorithms to precisely pinpoint the location of defects on products with sub-millimeter accuracy.
○	Process Variation Mapping: Generated high-definition maps of manufacturing process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure) with improved spatial resolution, enabling the identification of anomalies and inconsistencies.
○	Real-Time Mapping of Deviations: Optimized algorithms to allow for real-time mapping of deviations from standard operating procedures.
●	Outcome:
○	The system maintained defect localization accuracy, enabling precise robotic intervention for defect rectification.
○	Detailed maps of process variations contributed to identifying root causes of defects and optimizing manufacturing parameters.
○	Real-time deviation mapping allowed for immediate corrective actions, minimizing defective products.
●	Overview: In a quality control context, this refers to the "path" of inspection or intervention, as well as the navigation of robotic inspection systems.
●	Performance Enhancements:
○	Adaptive Inspection Paths: Combined pre-planned inspection routines with the ability to adapt to newly detected defects, ensuring comprehensive quality checks.
○	Multi-Objective Optimization: Balanced inspection speed, coverage area, and potential for product damage when planning inspection paths for robotic systems.
○	Real-Time Re-planning: Enabled robotic inspection systems to re-plan their paths in real-time to focus on critical defect areas or avoid obstacles on the factory floor.
●	Outcome:
○	Inspection systems efficiently covered products, ensuring thorough quality checks in a minimal amount of time.
○	The systems optimized inspection paths to minimize delays and potential damage.
○	Robots navigated the manufacturing floor safely and efficiently.
